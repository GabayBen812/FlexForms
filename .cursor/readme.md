# Paradise ERP - Cursor Integration

This folder defines how the AI assistant (Cursor) should behave inside this project.

- Rules are located under `rules/`.
- The configuration file (`config.json`) tells Cursor what to prioritize.
- These files guide the AI to:
  - Write code that follows your exact tech stack (NestJS + MongoDB + React + Tailwind)
  - Use your architectural conventions
  - Avoid irrelevant or incorrect code suggestions
