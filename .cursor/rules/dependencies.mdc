## Dependencies to Prefer

- **UI Components (Client):** shadcn/ui or Radix UI primitives
- **UI Components (Mobile):** Gluestack UI, React Native core components
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod
- **HTTP Client:** Axios (via apiClient)
- **Date Handling:** date-fns or dayjs
- **Icons (Client):** lucide-react
- **Icons (Mobile):** @expo/vector-icons (Feather, etc.)
- **Animations (Client):** framer-motion (when needed)
- **Animations (Mobile):** react-native-reanimated (already included)

## Dependencies to Avoid

- Avoid adding new state management libraries (use React Query + Context)
- Avoid jQuery or other DOM manipulation libraries
- Avoid class-based React components
- Avoid `any` in production code

## Performance Considerations

- Use React Query's caching effectively
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Lazy load routes when appropriate
- Optimize images and assets
- Use React.memo() only when profiling shows benefit
- Mobile: Use StyleSheet.create() outside render for better performance
- Mobile: Avoid inline styles in render functions
- Mobile: Use FlatList/ScrollView for long lists, implement proper keyExtractor
- Mobile: Consider image optimization and lazy loading for mobile data constraints
