# General Project Rules

- This is a **SaaS ERP platform** (Paradise ERP) designed to be **multi-tenant**.
- Maintain separation between backend and frontend code.
- Always aim for **clean, maintainable, and modular architecture**.
- Prefer **readability over cleverness** in code.
- When generating examples, assume environment: 
  - Backend at `localhost:3000`
  - Frontend at `localhost:5173`
- APIs should always return JSON with proper status codes.
- When unsure about structure, follow standard **NestJS + React best practices**.
