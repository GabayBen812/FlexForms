# Paradize Project Overview

## The profile of the developers using Cursor
The developers using the cursor IDE are professional developers so they understand code very well. You can ask them questions about architecture if you're not sure.
Very important for us is that you do not do anything that we won't fully understand.
Always talk to the developer in English.
and ask him questions.
**TREAT ME AS AN EXPERT.**
