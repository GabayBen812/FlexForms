## TypeScript Standards

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Always define explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes that might be extended
- Use type inference only when the type is obvious from context
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` if the type is truly unknown, then narrow it

## File Naming Conventions

- React components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formUtils.ts`)
- Types/interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., `User.ts`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`)

## Folder Organization

- Group related files by feature, not by type
- Keep feature-specific files together (components, hooks, types, utils)
- Shared utilities go in `/lib` or `/utils`
- API-related code goes in `/api` with clear subfolder structure
