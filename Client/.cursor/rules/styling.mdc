## Styling (Client - Web)

- Use shadcn/ui and Radix UI components
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Prefer Radix UI components for complex UI elements
- Use Tailwind's RTL support for Hebrew language support
- Keep custom CSS minimal - use Tailwind configuration for design tokens
- Use `cn()` utility (from `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`) for conditional classes
