## API Client

- Use the centralized API client (`api/client.ts` for Mobile) for all HTTP requests
- Organize API functions by feature in subfolders
- Always handle errors appropriately
- Use React Query hooks for data fetching and mutations
- Use SecureStore for auth cookies, handle cookie management in API interceptors

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors at the appropriate level
- Use React Query's error handling for API errors
- Display user-friendly error messages (internationalized)
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
