## Styling (Mobile - React Native)

- Use NativeWind for Tailwind-like utility classes (when convenient)
- Use StyleSheet.create() for component styles (preferred for performance)
- Use Gluestack UI components for complex UI elements (not shadcn/ui)
- Support RTL layouts - use `textAlign: 'right'` and `flexDirection: 'row-reverse'` for Hebrew
- Use SafeAreaView for all screens to handle device notches and status bars
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44 points for accessibility
- Use elevation and shadowColor for Android, shadowOpacity/shadowRadius for iOS
- Prefer flexbox layouts - mobile screens are constrained (320-428px width)
- Use LinearGradient from expo-linear-gradient for gradient buttons/backgrounds

## Performance Considerations

- Use StyleSheet.create() outside render for better performance
- Avoid inline styles in render functions
- Use FlatList/ScrollView for long lists, implement proper keyExtractor
- Consider image optimization and lazy loading for mobile data constraints
